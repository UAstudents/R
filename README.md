# R
Generalized repository for R code 

Here we can share full scripts or snippets of code we are working on in R (RStudio is recommended). We encourage everyone to make an online portion to whatever they are working on to supplement their projects, personal work, and/or CV.

Whether you are just beginning how to use R language or are advanced and practiced, you're code has a place in this repository.

No matter your level of academic education (undergraduate, post-bacc, young professional, graduate student, PhD, non-student), we are encouraging everyone who is interested in advancing and sharing their knowledge of coding to participate in this group.

Have fun and code on!
